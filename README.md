## Getting Started


### Starting the Database

First you need to set up the database using the drizzle-kit untilities.
Within you .env you need to set `DATABASE_URL` to the proper postgresql url. 

Then you need to run the following commands:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate: #Creates SQL migration files based on schema changes.
npx drizzle-kit migrate: #Runs the generated migration files against the database.
# or (but not recomended)
npx drizzle-kit push: #Instantly syncs the schema without needing migration files. 
```

### Starting the Web App
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Key API endpoints

and I think that is it!
